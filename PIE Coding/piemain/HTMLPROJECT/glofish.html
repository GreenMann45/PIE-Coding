                    <p style="font-size:25;">
                        GloFish&trade; are genetically engineered bioluminescent fish. (Fish that were modified to glow
                        in the dark) The original developer of these fish were Yorktown Technologies. <br>
                        They got bought out by Spectrum Brands, Inc. in 2017 who now owns the rights to the
                        GloFish&trade;. <br>
                        These fish were modified and created to be great, attractive pets your aquariums. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h2 align="center"> > How did they come to be? < </h2>
                            <p style="font-size:25;">
                                It started as an experiment on a Zebra Danio fish.
                                They wanted to insert the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and see if it would glow.
                                <br>
                                The experiment was a success, and they managed to make genetically modified
                                bioflourescent fish. <br>
                                They went on to make even more fish glow, and then releasing them to the public, making
                                them one of the first genetically engineered animals on the market.
